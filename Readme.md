# **React**


## 1. **Core React**

- JSX, Components (Class & Functional), Props, State
- Lifecycle Methods (for Class Components)
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, etc.)

## 2. **Advanced React**

- Context API & Compound Components
- Custom Hooks (for reusability and separation of concerns)
- Performance Optimization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, React Profiler)
- Error Boundaries & Suspense
- React Server Components (RSC)

## 3. **State Management**

- React Context + `useReducer`
- Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)
- Zustand, Recoil, Jotai (modern alternatives)
- Query Caching with React Query

## 4. **React Router**

- Route Parameters, Nested Routes, Dynamic Routing
- Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

## 5. **Forms & Validation**

- Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components
- Formik, React Hook Form + Yup

## 5. **React Testing**

- Unit Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Integration & E2E Testing (Cypress, Playwright)
