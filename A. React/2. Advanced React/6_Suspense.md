# 6. **Suspense**

Suspense is a powerful feature in React that helps `manage asynchronous operations, like data fetching and code splitting`, with a loading indicator while waiting for resources to be loaded. It allows you to declare a **fallback UI** while React waits for some resources to load, making the application feel more responsive and user-friendly.

## **Key Uses of Suspense:**
1. **`Code Splitting`**: Suspense can be used in combination with `React.lazy` to dynamically load components only when they are needed.
2. **`Data Fetching`**: Suspense can also be used with `Suspense`-enabled data fetching libraries to handle asynchronous data fetching in a way that is consistent with React's rendering lifecycle.

## **Real-World Example for `Suspense with Data Fetching`**

Imagine you are building an e-commerce site with a list of products. You want to fetch product data from an API and display it with a loading state while the data is being fetched. Using `Suspense` allows us to keep the UI responsive and show a loading state until the data is ready.

We'll use **React Suspense** for data fetching with a `fetch` operation, and we'll simulate this by creating a fake API that returns product data asynchronously.

## 1. **Setting Up an API to Simulate Data Fetching:**

```jsx
// Fake API function to simulate data fetching
const fetchProducts = () =>
  new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve([
        { id: 1, name: 'Product 1', price: 30 },
        { id: 2, name: 'Product 2', price: 50 },
        { id: 3, name: 'Product 3', price: 70 },
      ]);
    }, 2000) // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
  );
```

## 2. **Creating a Resource (Wrapper to Use Suspense)**

To make React aware that it should wait for the data, we'll need to create a "resource" that works with Suspense. This resource will be responsible for fetching the data and allowing Suspense to manage the loading state.

```jsx
// Create a resource that suspends until the data is fetched
const createResource = (fetchFn) => {
  let status = 'pending';
  let result;
  let promise = fetchFn().then(
    (res) => {
      status = 'success';
      result = res;
    },
    (error) => {
      status = 'error';
      result = error;
    }
  );

  return {
    read() {
      if (status === 'pending') {
        throw promise; // This will trigger Suspense to wait for the promise to resolve
      } else if (status === 'error') {
        throw result; // If there was an error during fetching
      } else {
        return result; // Return the data once it's fetched
      }
    },
  };
};

const productResource = createResource(fetchProducts);
```

## 3. **Creating the Component that Uses Suspense for Data Fetching**

Now that we have our resource (`productResource`), we can create a component that fetches the products using Suspense.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Product List Component that will fetch and display products
const ProductList = () => {
  const products = productResource.read(); // Suspends if data is still loading
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product List</h1>
      <ul>
        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>
            {product.name} - ${product.price}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 4. **App Component with Suspense for Data Fetching**

Finally, in the `App` component, we'll use `Suspense` to wrap the `ProductList` component. We can display a fallback UI, such as a loading spinner or message, while the products are being fetched.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading products...</div>}>
        <ProductList />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

# **How it Works:**
1. **Suspense** is used in the `App` component, and it wraps the `ProductList` component.
2. **productResource.read()** inside `ProductList` throws a promise if the data is not yet fetched. This triggers the Suspense fallback UI (`<div>Loading products...</div>`).
3. Once the data is fetched (after 2 seconds, in this case), the promise resolves, and React will render the `ProductList` with the fetched products.

# **Suspense + `React.lazy` for Code Splitting:**

You can combine **Suspense** with **`React.lazy`** for code splitting. `React.lazy` allows you to dynamically load components only when they are needed.

## **Example:**

```jsx
const LazyLoadedComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Lazy Component...</div>}>
        <LazyLoadedComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Here, `LazyLoadedComponent` will only be loaded when the `App` component renders, and until that happens, React will show the fallback UI (`<div>Loading Lazy Component...</div>`).

# **Summary:**

- **Suspense for Data Fetching**: Suspense lets you wrap components that need to wait for asynchronous data to be fetched, showing a loading state in the meantime.
- **React.lazy for Code Splitting**: Suspense works alongside `React.lazy` to load components only when they are needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving performance.
- **Fallback UI**: You can define any loading indicator or UI that should be displayed while React is waiting for data or code to load.

By using Suspense, React allows you to handle asynchronous operations in a declarative way, improving the user experience by displaying loading states and allowing for better performance optimizations through code splitting and lazy loading.
